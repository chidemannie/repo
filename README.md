## Introduction

Repository of courses for the Data Science Specialization Capstone provided by [Coursera from Johns Hopkins University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project/home/welcome)

### Course Dataset

Starting point and the most of the capstone will be based on the training data set supplied below.

* [Capstone Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip)

### Milestone Report

*Exploratory data analysis* and *Modeling* are covered in Week 2 of the Data Science Capstone project. The objective is to get knowledge of the data set's many statistical characteristics so that you may utilize it to design a prediction model for the final data product.

Students are required to produce a Milestone Report by the conclusion of week 2 that contains a summary of our plans for developing the text predictive model as well as a description of the key characteristics of the training data based on our exploratory data analysis.

* [Milestone Report available on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/chidemannie/989797)

### Final Project Submission

The objective of this final project assignment is to put a text prediction learning model into practice. Create a Shiny product with a user interface that people can access using the text prediction algorithm.

The source code files "ui.R" and "server.R" as well as the RStudio Presenter files for the created Shiny application may be found in this repository.

On shinyapps.io, the Shiny application is hosted, while RPubs hosts the Presentation's slides.
